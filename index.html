<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>Last updated:</b> January 19, 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how the application (MoviePicker) collects, uses,
and handles information when you use it.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><b>Device Identifier</b></p>

<p>
The App collects a randomly generated device identifier (UUID / FCUUID).
This identifier does not contain personal information and is generated locally
on the device. It is used solely for the internal functioning of the App,
such as distinguishing devices and maintaining app state.
</p>

<p><b>Analytics Data</b></p>

<p>
  The App uses Amplitude Analytics to collect usage data.
  A randomly generated device identifier (UUID / FCUUID) may be used as a user
  identifier within Amplitude to associate events from the same device.
  This identifier does not contain personal information and is not used for
  advertising or cross-app tracking.
</p>

<p>
  Analytics events do not include personal data and are not used to identify
  users as real persons.
</p>  

<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

<p>
We do not collect, store, or process:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
  <li>precise or approximate location data</li>
  <li>contacts, photos, videos, or audio recordings</li>
  <li>payment or financial information</li>
  <li>health data</li>
  <li>messages or user-generated content</li>
  <li>data used for cross-app or cross-site tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>
The limited information collected is used only to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the App functions correctly</li>
  <li>analyze aggregated usage patterns</li>
  <li>improve app stability, performance, and user experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
We do not sell, rent, or share collected data with third parties for advertising
or marketing purposes.
</p>

<p>
If third-party analytics services are used, data is shared only in anonymized
form and strictly for analytics and performance measurement.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

<p>
Anonymized analytics data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill
its purpose. Device identifiers are not linked to any personal data and are not
used to identify individual users.
</p>

<h2>6. User Rights</h2>

<p>
Because the App does not collect personal data, there is no personally
identifiable information to access, correct, or delete.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
on this page with an updated revision date.
